    <p>
        I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from Washington State University with a minor in Mathematics. My research spans robotics, machine learning, and AI safety, with a focus on reinforcement learning, human-AI collaboration, and large language models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™ve conducted research at Carnegie Mellon University (HARP Lab) on hierarchical reward learning, Oregon State University (CHARISMA Lab) on multi-robot navigation, and Washington State University (Doppa Lab). I also completed a software engineering internship at Google (STEP Intern), where I built scalable data processing and visualization systems to support internal analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was recently admitted to the Master of Science in Computer Science program at Georgia Tech, where I will begin in Spring 2026, specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML research and engineering while continuing to explore the intersection of foundation models and embodied intelligence.

        Please feel free to reach out about research, collaboration, or any advice I can help with!
