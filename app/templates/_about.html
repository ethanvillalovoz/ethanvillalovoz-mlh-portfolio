    <p>
        I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from Washington State University with a minor in Mathematics. My research spans robotics, machine learning, and AI safety, with a focus on reinforcement learning, human-AI collaboration, and large language models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™ve conducted research at Carnegie Mellon University (HARP Lab) on hierarchical reward learning, Oregon State University (CHARISMA Lab) on multi-robot navigation, and completed a software engineering internship at Google (STEP Intern), where I built scalable data processing and visualization systems to support internal analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML research and engineering while preparing to apply for M.S. programs in Spring 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please feel free to reach out about research, collaboration, or any advice I can help with!
