    <p>
        From an early age, I was fascinated by how technology can amplify human potential and solve real-world problems. My journey in computer science began with a curiosity for robotics and artificial intelligence, and has grown into a passion for building systems that are not only intelligent, but also safe, interpretable, and beneficial to society.

        Whether it’s developing expressive multi-robot behaviors, aligning AI with human values, or optimizing large-scale systems, I’m driven by the challenge of making technology more collaborative and trustworthy. I believe that the future of AI depends on our ability to bridge the gap between technical innovation and human needs.
